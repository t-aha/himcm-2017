**Wolfram Mathematica** was used to tackle the given problem and visualize any data we analyzed. Firstly, using Mathematica's instrinsic elevation data, a 3DListPlot was made that represented the terrain of Wasatch Peaks Ranch. <br>

Hermite Interpolation and Gaussian Filtration were then used to regress and smoothen the ListPlot in multiple dimensions to produce a derivative plot in three dimensions that could ascertain which areas of the ranch were too steep to be skiied upon.<br>

The plots created by this method were then colored to illustrate the exact regions that could not be incorporated into our final model. Next, a satellite image of the ranch was processed and dark colored pixels were removed as they represented areas of dense forestry - these regions are unskiiable and would take too much time/money to excavate. Finally, the walking paths and ski slopes of various difficulty were generated based on the steepness of various sections of the ranch.
